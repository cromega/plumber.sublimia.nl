Let's start this page with a bit of detour.

Every time someone asks me what I would have done if I hadn't got into this whole software biz, which doesn't happen that often to be brutally honest, I say baker.

I generally like the idea of baking nice things that look and smell and taste awesome. I sounds very Zen to me. Chances are my idea of baking as a trade is a very naive one but I don't let anyone ruin the image for me.

But here I am, wading knee-deep in code and infrastructure. All day, every day.

Generally speaking, I'm enjoying it a lot. Most of the time. When things work. And then when things don't work, I make them work. I hammer them into submission. with a pitchfork.

At this point, the attentive reader might have made a mental note about pitchforks not being notoriously effective as hammers. If you don't see why, here's a pitchfork:

Everyone who has something to do with the tech industry understands this whole "using weird tools for the job" and "duct taping everything" shenanigans so I'm not going to elaborate on it.

As a then new colleague of mine said after a few weeks of trying to get to terms with BOSH and deployments and containers, "Feels like I have to build this complicated structure out of Lego bricks that don't fit together."

I couldn't even say anything to that. I just raised my eyebrows and told to myself "Yep, he knows."

In this world everything is a bit broken. Sometimes very obviously broken, sometimes only subtly so. If it's not broken in some way then it probably failed to start. Except when they failed to start because they were broken.

In this world I am an engineer and I fix things.

In reality, I feel like a plumber who hammers things using the tools at hand, or, sometimes with the wonky tools I create for the job.

And when I have this:

My work is finally done.
