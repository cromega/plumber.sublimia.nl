I have been a relatively <del>happy</del> indifferent Oculus Rift owner pretty much since it started shipping.

Is it really that awesome? Have I cut contact with everyone I know becasue I've been busy playing with it all day and night ever since?

Yes it is that awesome. No, I haven't. I don't actually play all that much with it.

The short answer is: there is nothing really to play with it.

There are a few games in the Oculus store that are supposedly designed for VR but in all honesty, they don't look interesting enough to make me pay 50 pounds.
