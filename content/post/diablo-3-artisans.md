I have been playing Diablo 3 on and off since day 1. Mostly off. Every time I levelled up the artisans I did it all the way to max in one go. Each artisan level (up to 10) comes with a different design and I always wondered what the different stages looked like but I always forgot to take screenshots.

This time I have!

So, without further ado, this is what they look like:

Now I can sleep better.
